Under the nearly two-decade-old Free File deal, the industry agreed to make free versions of tax filing software available to lower- and middle-income Americans.
In exchange, the IRS promised not to compete with the industry by creating its own online filing system.
Under the new rules, participating companies also have to standardize the naming convention of their Free File version as “IRS Free File program delivered by [product name].” In the past, many tax filers reported being confused by the difference between, for example, TurboTax Free and TurboTax Free File.

It’s about a third of the total fly brain, and contains many of the critical regions responsible for memory, navigation, and learning.
Rubin hopes wiring diagrams such as this one, showing neurons involved in navigation, will give researchers a better sense of how brain circuits work.
The argument is that to get anywhere with understanding brain circuits, you first need to know what the circuits are, and what kinds of cells they join.
The complexity of the fly brain is two orders of magnitude greater—thus the three-decade gap in getting it done.",531,

At the same time, in pop songs like Eydie Gormé’s “Blame It on the Bossa Nova,” bossa nova meant something different: exotic and slightly upmarket, with a newly American-made dance to go along with it.
After divorcing Astrud and, in 1965, marrying another singer, Heloísa Buarque de Holanda — known in her own career as Miúcha — Mr. Gilberto moved to Weehawken, N.J., and then to Brooklyn.
In 1970 the couple relocated to Mexico, where during a two-year stay he recorded the album “João Gilberto en Mexico.” He then returned to the United States, where he stayed until returning to Brazil in 1980.

Kirmayer isn’t surprised to see that the clash between the old tradition of gender-segregated wedding parties and the new ubiquity of mixed-gender friendships is creating stressful situations.
But because the number of spots in a wedding party is often limited to just a handful, choosing to include one friend often means choosing to exclude another.
Single-sex wedding parties can already cause hurt feelings, “and because having mixed-gender bridal parties perhaps isn’t as common, that would create even more room for conflict,” Kirmayer told me.
That said, prioritizing the tradition of single-sex wedding parties over just asking your closest friends or family members to be wedding attendants can be equally hurtful, especially to those who find themselves without a role in the wedding because of their gender.",502,

It’s a wonderfully descriptive name because the algorithm takes a bunch of random data points (Random), cuts them to the same number of points and creates trees (Cut).
It then looks at all of the trees together (Forest) to determine whether a particular data point is an anomaly: Random Cut Forest.
Sample 2In the second data sample, the randomly selected data points are clustered more closely around the target data point.
Sample 2: Level five data points and treeThe final step performed by the Random Cut Forest algorithm is to combine the trees into a forest.",1518,

Isolation Forest, like any tree ensemble method, is built on the basis of decision trees.

Our team decided to focus on this specific issue by iterating on Lexikon, with the goal to improve the data discovery experience for data scientists and ultimately accelerate insights production.
Within the context of data discovery, a data scientist with low-intent has a broad set of goals and might not be able to identify exactly what it is they’re looking for.
Our belief was that by making these types of entities more explorable, we would open up new pathways for data discovery.
Since making these improvements to the data discovery experience in Lexikon we see that adoption of Lexikon amongst data scientists has increased from 75% to 95%, putting it in the top 5 tools used by data scientists.",2979,

Dr. Oxman is the founder of a discipline she calls material ecology, which marries the technological advances of computational design, synthetic biology and digital fabrication (otherwise known as 3-D printing) to produce compostable structures, glass objects that vary their optical and structural properties, and garments made from a single piece of silk fabric.",285,

With travel between Italian regions restricted until Tuesday, it was a local lineup, ready to experience what many Romans dream of: a tourist-free visit to one of the world’s greatest — and most popular — museums, which last year drew nearly seven million visitors.
Though she lives in Rome, Simona Toti, a statistician, said she hadn’t seen the Sistine Chapel for years “because of the mobs.”While online reservations have shortened the mile-long queue that once snaked along the walls of Vatican City to the museum entrance, many Rome residents are still daunted by the crowds, and the crowding.

“Math is really hard, and people sometimes overlook things.”So how do mathematicians know if a problem is currently impossible or just really hard?
If mathematicians have solved one problem, it boosts their confidence that they can solve another that looks kind of like it.
For example, two of the biggest open problems in the field of number theory are the twin primes conjecture and the Goldbach conjecture.
Experimental computations back up the conjecture, but mathematicians have no idea how to prove it — and they may never.",1471,

With this approach, you can keep all your Kubernetes YAML files under git repositories, which allows you to know precisely when a change was made, who made the change, and what exactly changed.
Having resources defined as YAML makes it super easy for cluster operators to change one or two numbers in a Kubernetes resource to change the scaling behavior.

Roast vegetables individually: First, and easiest, you can roast the individual vegetables on separate trays and combine them after roasting.
This lets you monitor how quickly each vegetable is cooking and pull each vegetable from the oven as it’s done.
Pair “vegetable friends”: Second, you can pair together “vegetable friends” — ones that roast at roughly the same rate.
If your vegetables still have some moisture after washing, be sure to pat them as dry as possible; the drier the vegetable, the better it will roast.",1391,

We provide initial insights for measuring a relative data advantage by answering three questions that are important when evaluating data competitiveness.
Does commercial data matter for military AI?
China’s access to commercial market data is unlikely to confer a military operational advantage; data needs for military AI applications are environment-specific, and little ability exists to transfer commercial data and machine learning models to military applications.",439,

I suggest that it is not in the intrinsic interest of human beings but in these ideas and accounts that the problem lies.
How exasperating that such extraordinary writers as Susan Sontag, Chinua Achebe, and Maya Angelou died without a Nobel Prize.
[…] Art attempts to find in the universe, in matter as well as in the facts of life, what is fundamental, enduring, essential.

In the process of creating high technology there are significant amounts of waste generated that give rise to health and environmental issues.
In addition, few of our current disposal methods, including recycling, are optimal – our options take for granted the high labor, environmental, energy and health impacts required to create the devices we've come to rely on.
