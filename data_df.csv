Brooks claims that the accidental complexity has decreased substantially, and today's programmers spend most of their time addressing essential complexity.

Munsell’s research produced the first perceptually ordered color space—a three-dimensional plot in which the axes represent hue (color), value (lightness or darkness), and chroma (intensity of color) [Moreland, 2016].
Absolute color spaces define color in terms of human perception.

The y-axis in a density plot is the probability density function for the kernel density estimation.
Density Plots in SeabornTo make density plots in seaborn, we can use either the distplot or kdeplot function.
For example, we can make a density plot showing all arrival delays on top of the corresponding histogram:# Density Plot and Histogram of all arrival delayssns.distplot(flights['arr_delay'], hist=True, kde=True,bins=int(180/5), color = 'darkblue',hist_kws={'edgecolor':'black'},kde_kws={'linewidth': 4})Density Plot and Histogram using seabornThe curve shows the density plot which is essentially a smooth version of the histogram.
There are even more univariate (single variable) plots we can make such as empirical cumulative density plots and quantile-quantile plots, but for now we will leave it at histograms and density plots (and rug plots too!).",2295,/Science,0.920000017,,,,Science

10 ML & NLP Research Highlights of 2019,2020-01-06 08:00:00+00:00,['Sebastian Ruder'],https://ruder.io/research-highlights-2019/?utm_campaign=Data_Elixir&utm_source=Data_Elixir_266,"['models', 'ml', 'al', 'research', 'methods', 'nlp', 'important', '2019', 'et', 'neural', 'training', 'model', 'highlights']","In computer vision, approaches leveraged self-supervision including CPC (Hénaff et al., 2019), MoCo (He et al., 2019), and PIRL (Misra & van der Maaten, 2019) as well as strong generators such as BigBiGAN (Donahue & Simonyan, 2019) to improve sample efficiency on ImageNet and image generation.
While winning tickets are still expensive to find, it is promising that they seem to be transferable across datasets and optimisers (Morcos et al., 2019) and domains (Desai et al., 2019).
Many approaches sought to make the Transformer more efficient mostly using different—often sparse—attention mechanisms, such as adaptively sparse attention (Correia et al., 2019), adaptive attention spans (Sukhbaatar et al., 2019), product-key attention (Lample et al., 2019), and locality-sensitive hashing (Kitaev et al., 2020).
Another trend was the distillation of large BERT models into smaller ones (Tang et al., 2019; Tsai et al., 2019; Sanh et al., 2019).
An important trend in this direction are human-written explanations that are being provided by more datasets (Camburu et al., 2018; Rajani et al., 2019; Nie et al., 2019).",2816,/Science/Computer Science,0.50999999,,,,Science

Attacking Machine Learning with Adversarial Examples,2017-02-24 18:05:02+00:00,[],https://openai.com/blog/adversarial-example-research/,"['models', 'attacker', 'examples', 'learning', 'attacking', 'adversarial', 'machine', 'defense', 'output', 'model', 'gradient']","Attempted defenses against adversarial examplesTraditional techniques for making machine learning models more robust, such as weight decay and dropout, generally do not provide a practical defense against adversarial examples.
The attacker can train their own model, a smooth model that has a gradient, make adversarial examples for their model, and then deploy those adversarial examples against our non-smooth model.
Adversarial examples are also hard to defend against because they require machine learning models to produce good outputs for every possible input.
We encourage machine learning researchers to get involved and design methods for preventing adversarial examples, in order to close this gap between what designers intend and how algorithms behave.

Buying algorithmically has allowed marketers to optimise on the whole range of diﬀerent digital metrics in the pursuit of increased eﬃciency.
For a long time, the scourge of digital has been the desire to plan to what can be easily measured rather than that is right.

Despite its appearance, the tunnel did not actually lead directly to a disconcertingly utopian future, but only to the elevators that ferried the building’s blue-collar workers up to their workplaces.
Completed in 1971, 127 John Street was originally designed as a classic slab of second-wave International Style corporate office space by architecture practice Emery Roth & Sons.
Why should a 250-foot stretch of corrugated steel sewer culvert decorated with neon piping constitute such a commanding and beguiling image of “the future”?
Several of the artists—including Howard Brandston—-involved in creating 127 John Street’s installations successfully sued the new developers under the Visual Artists’ Rights Act; unfortunately, the elements of the decor preserved by the settlement did not include the tunnel.",773,/Arts & Entertainment/Visual Art & Design,0.779999971,,,,Arts & Entertainment

After divorcing Astrud and, in 1965, marrying another singer, Heloísa Buarque de Holanda — known in her own career as Miúcha — Mr. Gilberto moved to Weehawken, N.J., and then to Brooklyn.
In 1970 the couple relocated to Mexico, where during a two-year stay he recorded the album “João Gilberto en Mexico.” He then returned to the United States, where he stayed until returning to Brazil in 1980.

But because the number of spots in a wedding party is often limited to just a handful, choosing to include one friend often means choosing to exclude another.
Single-sex wedding parties can already cause hurt feelings, “and because having mixed-gender bridal parties perhaps isn’t as common, that would create even more room for conflict,” Kirmayer told me.

If a person asks a machine “How tall are you?” and the machine wants to win the Turing test, it has no choice but to confabulate.

After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, for example, doctors had to decide who to evacuate first from hospitals left without power or running water as temperatures soared above 100 degrees fahrenheit.
The Lancet, a peer-reviewed medical journal, laid out several approaches to translate these values into real life practices.

With travel between Italian regions restricted until Tuesday, it was a local lineup, ready to experience what many Romans dream of: a tourist-free visit to one of the world’s greatest — and most popular — museums, which last year drew nearly seven million visitors.
Though she lives in Rome, Simona Toti, a statistician, said she hadn’t seen the Sistine Chapel for years “because of the mobs.”While online reservations have shortened the mile-long queue that once snaked along the walls of Vatican City to the museum entrance, many Rome residents are still daunted by the crowds, and the crowding.
“Normally it’s so packed that you just can’t appreciate anything,” Ms. Toti said.",158,/Travel/Tourist Destinations,0.910000026,/Reference/Libraries & Museums/Museums,0.829999983,,Travel

“Math is really hard, and people sometimes overlook things.”So how do mathematicians know if a problem is currently impossible or just really hard?
If mathematicians have solved one problem, it boosts their confidence that they can solve another that looks kind of like it.
For example, two of the biggest open problems in the field of number theory are the twin primes conjecture and the Goldbach conjecture.

Decolonizing Design HistoryThe work designers make is inspired by taste, and taste is often derived from what we’re exposed to during our upbringing.

“Our goal was really that you have the Met experience,” Mr. Hollein said, “meaning that you don’t just have one wing open, but you see this great institution in all its different aspects, and it’s a museum that you know and that you love.”The Met will test out a free bike valet service, organized with Transportation Alternatives, the bicycle and pedestrian advocacy group.
“People can come leave their bikes for as long as they want,” said Danny Harris, the group’s executive director.
“When they come back, their bike will be waiting for them to get wherever they need to go.”The bikes — each of which will be sanitized — will be parked on the plaza, just north of the main steps.",172,/Hobbies & Leisure,0.560000002,/Travel,0.550000012,,Hobbies & Leisure
